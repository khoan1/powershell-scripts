# Logon

This folder includes PowerShell scripts that run when a user logs onto a system. These scripts help track user activity and provide reminders for account maintenance.

## Scripts

- **check-password-expiry.ps1** – Checks how many days are left before a user's password expires and shows a warning message if it's close.

- **logon-user-info.ps1** – Logs basic information about the user logging in, such as username, computer name, and timestamp.

These scripts are useful for improving user awareness and auditing login activity.
