# Active Directory (AD) Scripts

Scripts are organized into folders based on their function:

• AD Structure – scripts for user management and organizational unit (OU) structure.

• Logon – scripts that run when users log on to endpoints.

• Startup – scripts that run when endpoints start up from a powered-off state.

• Screenshots - folder contains images from a test environment modeled after a local hospital's AD.
