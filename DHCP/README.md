# DHCP

This folder includes PowerShell scripts for managing and auditing DHCP server and client configurations.

## Scripts

- **audit-dhcp-leases.ps1** – Lists all active DHCP leases from the server for review and documentation.
- **backup-dhcp-config.ps1** – Backs up current DHCP server configuration to XML format.
- **dhcp-lease-cleaner.ps1** – Identifies and removes expired or inactive DHCP leases.
- **dhcp-scope-client.ps1** – Logs the DHCP scope, IP address, and lease details from the client side.

These scripts assist with DHCP maintenance, monitoring, and backup tasks in Windows-based environments.
